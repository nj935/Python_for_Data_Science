# Python for Data Science
# Week 1 - Intro to Python
### Overview
Today we'll introduce the basics of Python. We will start with declaring variables and handling different data types, then use loops and conditionals to control the flow of your code's execution.

### Resources
Please work through the [Learn The Basics](http://learnpython.org/) section on LearnPython.org before coming to class. Alternatively, pick one of the comparable learning resources (eg. Python 101 on CodeAcademy) that covers the same ground.

Optional:
* chapters 1-2 of [Think Python](http://greenteapress.com/thinkpython2/thinkpython2.pdf)
* short tutorial on [markdown](https://commonmark.org/help/).

### In class: code demo.
We'll run through the Jupyter Notebook.

### In class: Lab.
You then have 40 minutes to work through the challenges in the Lab notebook. Run it in Google Colab.
